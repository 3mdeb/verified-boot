# Verified Boot Knowledge Base

## Goal

The purpose of this repository is to document and analyze various Verified Boot
mechanisms used in the industry. The goal is to focus on referring to reliable
sources, describing key concepts, without repeting the content too much.

## Scope

This repository focuses on a comprehensive review of Verified Boot mechanisms
at both firmware and operating system levels. It includes descriptions of key
concepts and technologies implemented across different platforms.

## Target Audience

- OS developers
- OEMs
- Advanced users interested in Verified Boot mechanisms

## Intended Use

This knowledge base serves as an educational resource for users, developers,
and the wider community. It provides insights into the existing Verified Boot
approaches, their advantages, and potential areas for improvement.

## Final Goal

While the initial goal is to document and review existing Verified Boot
mechanisms, the long-term objective is to design or select a robust Verified
Boot solution, that can be adopted by Linux-based Operating Systems, such as
[Kicksecure](https://www.kicksecure.com/).

## Dream Goal

A broader vision for this project is to contribute towards an open standard for
Verified Boot that can be utilized across all Linux distributions, and
potentially any operating system.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from developers, security researchers, and community
members who are interested in improving the Verified Boot knowledge base. Your
expertise and insights will help shape a more secure computing environment.
