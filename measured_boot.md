# Measured Boot

Measured boot is a security mechanism designed to verify that all the firmware
and software executed during the boot process are trusted by measuring them
and documenting the measurements for future validation.

Contrary to verified boot[^VerifiedBoot], measured boot does not prevent
untrusted code from being executed, but it makes it impossible for the execution
of such code to go undetected.

Every single piece of code executed since the start up to the end of the
measured boot process has its digest calculated. The digests, called
measurements, are then stored for future reference using the Root of Trust
for Storage. The Root of Trust for Reporting allows to reliably analyze the
measurements history stored in the RTS and make decisions on the trust towards
the platform depending on whether the sequence of code executed up to a point
is expected, or if a security breach could have happened.

This page will focus on the practical realisation of measured boot
using a TPM module. Some more theory regarding the process and the definitions
of basic concepts can be found on the [Verified Boot Page](./verified_boot_main.md)

## Measured Boot and the Trusted Platform Module

The Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is a secure cryptoprocessor, a dedicated
microprocessor seperate from the CPU, able to perform cryptographic operations
in a secure, tamper resistant environment. The TPM was created by the
Trusted Computing Group, which maintains and develops its
specification[^TPM_Spec]. The second edition of the specification is published
as the is the ISO/IEC 11889[^TPM_standard] standard.

The Trusted Platform Module is often used in modern systems in the process of
measured boot as the Root of Trust for Storage and the
Root of Trust for Reporting.

### Root of Trust for Storage

The TPM contains a volatile and non-volatile storage, which are not directly
available to the rest of the system and are guarded by the TPM.
Thanks to these storages, the TPM can be used as the the Root of Trust for
Storage.

#### Platform Configuration Register (PCR)

The PCRs[^TPM_spec_11-6-2] are small secure memory locations in the TPM which
can be read by the system freely, but cannot be directly written to.
A PCR can only be modified by:

- resetting[^TPM_spec_17-1]
- extending[^TPM_spec_17-2]

Extending a PCR is a key operation in the process of measured boot using TPM.
Extending a hash consists of appending some data to the bytes of the hash and
calculating the hash of the resulting bytes sequence.
Every measured boot measurement is recorded by adding it to a measurement log
and performing a hash extension of a value in a PCR and the measured component's
digest. The resulting hash value is then set as the new value of
the PCR by the TPM.

The integrity of the measurement log can be verified by calculating and
extending all the digests in the log. The resulting value can be compared
against the one saved in a PCR as any change to the chain of measured components
will result in a different hash value in the end.

Comparing the values in PCRs to some well-known ones allows to verify the
integrity of all the components measured during the process of measured boot
in one operation.

### Root of Trust for Reporting

The TPM allows to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the data read from
its storage. Because of that it can act as the
Root of Trust for Reporting of the data stored in the TPM's storage.

One way this can be achieved is by creating a HMAC[^NIST_HMAC] session with the
TPM[^TPM_spec_17-7-2]. The PCR value will be provided alongside a HMAC allowing
for verifying that it comes from the TPM chip and was not altered in any way.

### Not a Root of Trust for Measurements

The TPM can not act as the RTM, because it is not able to initiate the
measurements. The TPM is only a tool which is operated by the CPU[^TPM_spec_34-1].
The TPM can securely store and report its storage allowing for recording
the platform state reliably, but the whole process is controlled by the code
running on the CPU.

### Data Sealing and Unsealing

Sealing and Unsealing is a functionality of the TPM that allows saving any data
in a Shielded Location [^TPM_spec_4-89] where the access to the data is
controlled by the Autorization Subsystem [^TPM_spec_11-5] where a set of
policies can be used to control the access to the data.

The process of saving the data is called `sealing`. Such data can only be
`unsealed` if the given set of Policies is satisfied.

Sealing an object with an unseal policy so that a set of PCRs has to have
defined valuesÂ (PolicyPCR) can be used to make sure a secret is only revealed
if the platform is in an expected state, that is no untrusted code was executed
up to a given point. Sealing a piece of data crucial for the boot process,
like the disk password, can prevent the platform from booting and
potentially exposing sensitive data when the platform is not in a trusted
state.

An example of a more complex unseal policy is given in the TPM specification
where a PolicyPCR and a PolicyAuthorize are used together as alternatives
to allow unsealing the secret during a BIOS update. The Update changes the
PCR values making the PolicyPCR fail, but using a signature from the
platform OEM supplying the BIOS update the PolicyAuthorize is satisfied
and the keys are unsealed by the TPM.[^TPM_spec_19-7-11]

### TPM Key Hierarchies

The TPM is able to generate asymmetric keypairs for specific uses and
act as an authority for attesting the trust towards them. Every key
created using the TPM is a part of some `key hierarchy`.

The key hierarchies are mechanisms of transitive trust, just like the chains
of trust. The trust is transitioned from a `Primary Key` of a hierarchy
down to other keys of the same hierarchy, which in turn can be used to encrypt,
decrypt, sign and verify any data.

The primary keys used to verify the trust towards other keys are not stored
in the non-volatile memory of the TPM, but are instead generated when needed
using the `Primary Seed` of a given key hierarchy.
Generating the Primary Keys is deterministic and will always produce the same key
for a given set of attributes allowing to save space in the TPM's secure NVRAM.
The private parts of Primary Keys never leave the TPM.

The TPM specification defines three `Primary Key Seeds`, and their corresponding
key hierachies[^TPM_spec_14-4]:
- Endorsement Primary Seed (EPS)
- Storage Primary Seed (SPS)
- Platform Primary Seed (PPS)

The Primary Key Seeds never leave the TPM and are the most important secrets
held by it as all the keys used by the TPM are derived from them.

#### Endorsement Key hierarchy

The Endorsement Key (EK)[^TPM_spec_14-4-2] is the identity of the Root of Trust
for Reporting[^TPM_spec_9-4-4-2]. All the data that is reported by the TPM,
like the PCR values, is authorized to the Endorsement Key.

#### Platform Key hierarchy

A Platform Key (PK)[^TPM_spec_14-4-3] and its hierarchy is controlled by and
used by the platform firmware. The TPM can generate the PK for the
firmare's use, like signing firmware and software components for [verified boot](./verified_boot_main.md).

#### Storage Root Key hierarchy

Storage Root Key (SRK)[^TPM_spec_14-4-4] and the hierarchy of keys signed by
it are controlled by the platform owner. The keys can be used by the OS and
applications for any use, like sealing some secret by encrypting it on the
disk making it only accessible when a policy is satisfied, or for authorization.

## Static and Dynamic RTM

Measured Boot can be performed basing on: Static RTM or Dynamic RTM.
Achieving measured boot using the two Roots of Trust differ in how the process
is performed and each has its strenghts and shortcomings. The two techniques can
even be used together to achieve the best results[^Intel_txt_security_paper].

### SRTM

The Static Root of Trust for Measurements creates a Chain of Trust, which
starts with the first code executed on the CPU. The code is often read only,
proprietary and provided by the hardware vendor. From there, every executed
software is being measured and added to the chain of trust extending the
Trusted Computing Base. The process is simple, but the resulting
Trusted Computing Base can end up being large and its security can be difficult
to audit.

### DRTM

The main difference between Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement from the SRTM
is that the DRTM  does not start with the first code executed on the CPU,
but with the execution of a special CPU instruction
(Intel - SINIT[^Intel_txt_security_paper], AMD - SKINIT[^AMD_DRTM_guide]).

The instruction allows to exclude the boot code, the firmware and the
bootloader, from the TCB by allowing them to run during platform boot, but
ensuring they won't affect the security of the platform after the special
D-RTM CPU instruction is executed. The code executed after the DRTM
initialization instruction is said to run in a measured environment (Intel),
or a secure execution environment (AMD).

### Why use SRTM and DRTM at the same time

Because modern CPUs include features like the Intel ME and AMD ASP, which are
more privileged than any other code on the CPU, the environment in which the
platform will execute code after the DRTM initialization instruction can not be
entirely hermetized from them.

For this reason SRTM and DRTM should be used together[^Intel_txt_security_paper_srtm_and_drtm],
so that the highly priviledged components like Intel ME and AMD ASP can be
verified using SRTM, and the code running in a measured environment created
using the DRTM, while not entirely hermetized, can at least depend on the
SRTM measurements.

This way the TCB of the SRTM can be reduced to the highly priviledged hardware
components that can affect the measured environment of the DRTM, and the TCB
of the DRTM can be left unchanged, and minimal.

### Pros and cons of SRTM and DRTM

|--|--|--|
|First measurements|First CPU instructions|Anywhere and anything|
|Size of TCB|Large|Minimal|
|Implementation and use|Simple|Complex|
